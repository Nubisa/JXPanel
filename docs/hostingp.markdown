# Hosting Plans

Hosting Plans may be described as sets of various parameters and limits.
Those sets may be then assigned to any sub-users added to JXPanel by the user, who created the set.

For example, super-user creates a hosting plan named *Default* and a user *guest_one*.
The form for creating a user (add new user &#40;todo&#41; contains a <b>Hosting Plan</b> combobox,
where the *Default* hosting plan (or any other created later) can be selected and assigned to the user.
