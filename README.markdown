# JXPanel manual and documentation

## What is JXPanel

JXPanel is a software solution for web hosting of Node.JS/JXcore applications.
Allows a server administrator (as well as each of the other users) to maintain [Hosting Plans](docs/hostingp.markdown), [Users](users.markdown) or [Domains](domains.markdown)
and to launch node applications for specific internet domains.

It also offers browser-based [File Manager](docs/filem.markdown) for creating and editing files or folders and well as shell access through [Remote Management](remotem.markdown).

Embedded FTP Server handles ftp operations for users with enabled ftp access.

JXPanel may also be extended by developers thanks to the supported addon's engine.
Full documentation may be found here: [Add-On documentation](docs/addons_api_index.markdown).
