Please note, that it is not advisable to upload files with extensively higher resolution (e.g. 3000x3000 pixels) or big file size,
since it may affect browser's page refreshing performance.

## {{label.LoginPage}} welcome text

There is a welcome text displayed on the {{label.LoginPage}}, but only for large and medium screens (Desktops â‰¥ 992 px).

The text can be replaced with any html contents.

By default the following code is displayed:

```html
{{viewplain.customLoginText}}
```

Please note, that the html is fully compatible with [Bootstrap 3](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/) template,
hence you may use all bootstrap features (e.g. predefined classes like `col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6` etc.).
