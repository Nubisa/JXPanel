Only the following extensions of a logo file are supported: .gif .png .jpg .jpeg.

Recommended size for uploaded file is 300x60 pixels. Larger images can be uploaded, but will be scaled down to that fit that dimensions.
Please note, that it is not advisable to upload files with extensively higher resolution (e.g. 3000x3000 pixels) or big file size,
since it may affect browser's page refreshing performance.

## Login page welcome text

There is a welcome text displayed on the Login page, but only for large and medium screens (Desktops â‰¥ 992 px).

The text can be replaced with any html contents.

By default the following code is displayed:

```html
&lt;div class="hero"&gt;<br>    Welcome...<br><br>&lt;/div&gt;<br><br>&lt;div class="row"&gt;<br>    &lt;div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6"&gt;<br>        &lt;h5 class="about-heading"&gt;About SmartAdmin - Are you up to date?&lt;/h5&gt;<br>        &lt;p&gt;Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa.&lt;/p&gt;<br>    &lt;/div&gt;<br>    &lt;div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6"&gt;<br>        &lt;h5 class="about-heading"&gt;Not just your average template!&lt;/h5&gt;<br>        &lt;p&gt;Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi voluptatem accusantium!&lt;/p&gt;<br>    &lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;
```

Please note, that the html is fully compatible with [Bootstrap 3](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/) template,
hence you may use all bootstrap features (e.g. predefined classes like `col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6` etc.).
