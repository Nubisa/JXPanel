# What is JXPanel

JXPanel is a software solution for web hosting of Node.JS/JXcore applications.
Allows a server administrator (as well as each of the other users) to maintain hosting plans &#40;todo&#41;, users &#40;todo&#41; or domains &#40;todo&#41;
and to launch node applications for specific internet domains.

It also offers browser-based file manager &#40;todo&#41; for creating and editing files or folders and well as shell access through remote management &#40;todo&#41;.

Embedded FTP Server handles ftp operations for users with enabled ftp access.

JXPanel may also be extended by developers thanks to the supported addon's engine.
