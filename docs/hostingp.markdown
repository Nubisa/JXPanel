# Hosting Plans

Hosting Plans may be described as sets of various parameters and limits.
Those sets may be then assigned to any sub-users added to JXPanel by the user, who created the set.

For example, super-user creates a hosting plan named *Default* and a user *guest_one*.
The form for creating a user (add new user &#40;todo&#41; contains a <b>Hosting Plan</b> combobox,
where the *Default* hosting plan (or any other created later) can be selected and assigned to the user.

## Table list

The table list on Hosting Plans page lists all hosting plans created by currently logged-in user.

The number of columns in the table may vary depending on width of the screen.
For example, on mobile devices there may be visible only first two of the columns: <b>Plan name</b> and <b>Status</b>.

Clicking the chosen row will get you to the hosting's plan modification form.
It is exactly the same form as addplan, except that it is in edit mode now.

## Adding new hosting plan

There is a button <span style="color: #f8f8f8; margin: 0 2px 0 0; padding: 5px 10px 5px 10px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap; background: #000000; border-radius: 2px;">Add new hosting plan</span> on the top of the Hosting Plans page.

However, in case when the hosting plan to which you belong does not allow to add any plans,
or you already have maximum allowed number of hosting plans (<b>Max plans</b>) then you will see appropriate error message.
